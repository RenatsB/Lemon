## **Requirements**
___

The main requirement to run this project is NGL and everything NGL requires to be built and used.

This project is based off bump from rendering-examples:

https://github.com/NCCA/rendering_examples.git

and SimplePBR from PBR:

- TessTest: "TessTest" [2] (broken)
- NoiseDisplay: "NoiseDisplay" [3]
- DispColour: "DispColour" [4]
